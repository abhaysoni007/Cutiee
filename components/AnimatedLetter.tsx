Hey love,

I don't know how to perfectly say all that I feel, but today I just wanted to pause for a moment and write something honest â€” something simple, something soft, just like the way you make me feel.

You've quietly become such a huge part of my world. Whether it's your smile, your voice, your weird jokes, or the way you get excited over the tiniest things â€” it all just sticks with me. It makes the everyday stuff better. Lighter. Happier.

I know I tease you a lot, and you roll your eyes at me even more (and yes, I secretly enjoy that), but through all the laughs and sarcasm, there's one thing that never changes â€” I genuinely care for you. Like, really care. You're not just someone I love â€” you're someone I feel at home with.

I might not be perfect, but I promise I'll always try to be someone who makes you feel loved, safe, and understood. Someone you can laugh with at 2 AM, cry with when it gets heavy, and just be your weird, beautiful self around â€” no filters.

You matter to me. And I'm lucky to have someone like you to share life with â€” its calm days, its storms, and everything in between.

So yeah... just thought you should know that you're loved â€” deeply, honestly, quietly, and playfully. Always.

Your Beloved
`;
